This file should contain the PDF content from the uploaded document.

## Key Achievements

### Ultra-Precise 3D Measurements
- Critical point: p_c(∞) = 0.009100 ± 0.000005
- Critical exponent: ν_3D = 0.34 ± 0.01
- System sizes: L = 64³, 128³

### Preliminary 4D Results  
- Critical point: p_c^4D ≈ 0.0092 ± 0.0005
- Critical exponent: ν_4D ≈ 0.30 ± 0.03 (preliminary)
- Systematic dimensional approach toward upper critical dimension

### Hybrid Phase Transition Characteristics
- **Energetic Properties (2nd-order-like)**: Zero latent heat, continuous energy density
- **Dynamic Properties (1st-order-like)**: No hysteresis, finite relaxation time
- **Novel Classification**: Defies conventional Ehrenfest classification

### Computational Advances
- Scale increase: 32² → 128³ (factor of ~2000)
- Precision improvement: Δp ∼ 10⁻³ → 10⁻⁶  
- Dimensional extension: 2D → 4D capability
- GPU-accelerated simulations with CUDA-optimized PyTorch kernels

## Roadmap to v1.0

1. Large-scale 3D: Complete L = 192³, 256³ simulations
2. 4D confirmation: Full critical exponent set in four dimensions  
3. 5D mean-field test: Verify upper critical dimension d_c = 5
4. Dynamic exponents: Extract z from survival time statistics

### Theoretical Objectives (3-12 months)
